      <h1 class="title">Oh God, what have I done?</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</h2>
<p>We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
<p>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. Kif might! Quite possible. <strong> We live long and are celebrated poopers.</strong> <em> Interesting.</em> No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</p>
<h2>I can explain. It's very valuable.</h2>
<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look, last night was a mistake.</li><li>Who are you, my warranty?!</li><li>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</li>
</ol>

<h3>I'm a thing.</h3>
<p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Okay, I like a challenge. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</li><li>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</li><li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? It must be wonderful. We don't have a brig.</p>
<p>As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
<p>And until then, I can never die? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
<p>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
<p>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Take me to your leader! You don't know how to do any of those. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! No. We're on the top. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Professor, make a woman out of me. You're going to do his laundry?</p>
<p>Fatal. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
<p>That's not soon enough! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Why would a robot need to drink?</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
<p>Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Bender?! You stole the atom. Tell them I hate them. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</p>
<p>This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Hello Morbo, how's the family? Why would a robot need to drink? Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
